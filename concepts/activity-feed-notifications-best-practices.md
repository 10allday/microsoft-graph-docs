# Best practices for using Microsoft Teams activity feed notifications
This article covers best practices to help you build experiences using Microsoft Teams activity feed notifications in Microsoft Graph.

## Best practices for partner apps
Activity feed notifications enable partner apps to send notifications to users. These notifications are sent as toast items and activity feed items that point users to relevant content that can be consumed within Teams. Apply the following best practices in your partner app:

* Have knowledge of the direct relationship between a notification toast or feed, and the content it is deep linked to.
    * The notification must not confuse the user about what they need to address or triage. For example, if an *@mention* notification is received, the panel on the right in the activity feed app must display or reference the corresponding *@mention*.
    * If the notification pertains to removal or deletion, direct users to the content indicating the action, so that they understand the outcome before taking action. For example, remove a user from a group or delete a list.
* Ensure that the right pane experience in the feed is self-contained and does not break the feed experience. For example, if the notification leads to a modal or pop-up dialog, the modal must exist only within the app and not over the activity feed experience.
* Check if the apps are sending more than 10 notifications per minute, per user. 
  > [!NOTE]
  > Notifications are throttled if the per user notification count exceeds 10.
* Ensure that the apps are performing. The time taken for an app to load is measured and can impact the user experience when a user switches between notifications in the activity feed.

### Guide on feature behavior
This section covers feature behavior that you must be aware of when working with partner apps.
* Understand that selecting a toast notification leads to the activity feed. To switch to an activity, select a notification in the activity feed.
  > [!NOTE] 
  > The notification selection will not switch to the app.
* Localize the content in a notification toast or feed. The localization happens only if the appâ€™s content is [localized](/platform/concepts/build-and-test/apps-localization).
* Provide appropriate titles and descriptions for your **Activity Types**, because the setting titles are read from the app manifest. The following table provides examples of appropriate and inappropriate titles and descriptions:

   | **Appropriate** | **Inappropriate** |
   |-----------------|-------------------|
   |Use short titles, such as **@mention** and **Announcements**. | Do not use long titles, such as **User at-mentioned activity** and **Post creation activity**. |
 
* Ensure that the notifications are not promotional in nature. They must convey something important that the user must be aware about. The following table provides examples of important and promotional messages:

  | **Important message** | **Promotional message** |
  |-----------------------|-------------------------|
  | Lynne mentioned you in a message. | Try the new feature in the Cycling app! |

* Inform the user that the notifications are stored in the activity feed for 30 days. 
  > [!NOTE]
  > The 30 days storage limit applies to all notifications and is not specific to notifications sent through the activity feed notifications API.

When using the feature behavior you must be aware of the following:
  * The setting appears for the user only when the selected app sends a notification.
  * The app icon for each notification cannot be customized, and is the one that is included in the app manifest.
  * Currently, notifications can only be sent at a user level and not at a group or a team level.
    > [!NOTE]
    > Currently, priority notifications are not supported.

## Simplify the notification experience
Apply best practices that will help you send only the important information through your notifications.
* Improve chances of users acting on your notifications by sending relevant notifications directly. Users receive notifications from multiple sources across chats, channels, meetings, or other apps, therefore, do not send large volume of non-directed notifications. The following table provides examples of relevant and irrelevant messages:

  |**Relevant message** | **Irrelevant message** |
  |---------------------|-------------------------|
  | Diego assigned a sales ticket to you. | Joni left the sales team. *This notification may be noisy unless this is materially important.* |
  
* Avoid duplicate notifications from bot messages and activity feed notifications. For more information, see [guide to the difference between bot framework messages and activity feed notifications](#guide-to-the-difference-between-bot-framework-messages-and-activity-feed-notifications).
* Utilize the third line for the preview to give users information that allows them to gauge the importance and take action. Select a toast or mark for follow-up.

* Do not add a *period* at the end of the notification title to achieve parity with all other notification settings in Teams.

## Guide to the difference between bot framework messages and activity feed notifications
Based on the need the user can either use bot framework messages or activity feed notifications to notify the user. The following table provides the key differences between bot framework messages and activity feed notifications:

|**Bot messages**|**Activity feed notifications**|
|------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Bot messages are delivered as chat or channel messages. If the user's notifications for chat or channel is turned on, they trigger notifications as chat or channel notifications. </br> * *@mention* the name of the user for the notification to appear in the activity feed. </br> * It is useful if the alert is consumed as a chat or channel message or is consumed broadly. For example, message is consumed by all channel members.| The activity feed notifications land in the activity feed and can deep link to various locations. These notifications:</br> * allow the user to take action or triage the notification. </br> * lead the user to a tab in a chat or channel, a personal app, or a chat or channel message. </br> * are currently directed at a user level and are not posted broadly in a channel for all channel members to see. However, if the notification is deep linked to a channel message, then it is posted broadly in a channel. |
|  |The activity feed notification API allows users to configure notifications for each **Notification type** from the app. The capability to configure a notification allows the user to turn on or turn off specific notifications. |
| |Users can receive double notifications from the app. The app can send bot notifications to chats or channels and also activity feed notifications API notifications. *Send double notifications only if the scenario requires you to send them.* |
| | The activity feed notification API can send delegated or application-only calls. In delegated calls, the sender of the notification appears as the user who initiated the notification, for example, *John Doe*, and in application-only the sender appears as the app, for example, *Contoso*. |
| | You can update an existing activity feed notification instead of creating a new notification by using the `chainId` parameter.|
