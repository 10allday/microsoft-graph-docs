# Sent emails with MIME content
Email clients have the ability to send emails through Exchange in a MIME message format, containing the sender/recipient information (CC, BCC), message body contents as well as attachments. This including sending replies, reply-alls, and forwarding emails.

In addition, email clients can attach S/MIME digital signatures to emails as well as S/MIME encrypted email contents. 

As well, updating message drafts in Exchange with MIME content is available, including updating attachments, message body contents, and recipient information.

Visit the documentation about [getting MIME content of a message](../concepts/outlook-get-mime-message.md).
