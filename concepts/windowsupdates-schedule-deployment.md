# Schedule a deployment using the Windows Update for Business deployment service

When deploying an update using the deployment service, you can schedule the deployment so that devices receive the update at a future date.

Scheduling features are compatible with deployments of Windows 10 feature updates.

## Schedule a deployment to start at a future date

You can schedule a deployment to start at a future date by configuring its rollout settings. In the example below, all devices assigned the deployment will be offered the update on July 1, 2021.

### Request

```http
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/admin/windows/updates/deployments
Content-type: application/json

    },

        }
    }
}
```

            }

            "endDateTime": null,
            "durationBetweenOffers": "P1D",
            "devicesPerOffer": null
        },
        "monitoring": null,
        "userExperience": null
    },
    "createdDateTime": "String (timestamp)",
    "lastModifiedDateTime": "String (timestamp)"
}
```

## Stage a deployment over a period of time

You can also schedule a deployment so that assigned devices are offered the update in a gradual rollout that is staged over time. The update will be offered to subsets of devices assigned to the deployment at regular intervals, with the total duration of the rollout determined by either an end date or offering rate. You can think of a gradual rollout as similar to a recurring calendar event series.

One way to stage a deployment over time is to set the `endDateTime` of the deployment. All devices assigned to the deployment will be offered the update within the window between the `startDateTime` and `endDateTime`. If the `startDateTime` is not specified, then the deployment will begin as soon as devices are assigned.

In this example, a new deployment is configured so that a new set of devices is offered the update every week (`durationBetweenOffers` set to seven days), starting on July 1, 2021. All devices will be offered the update before August 1, 2021.

        "userExperience": null

    "createdDateTime": "String (timestamp)",
    "lastModifiedDateTime": "String (timestamp)"
}
```

Another way to stage a deployment over time is to configure the offering rate using `devicesPerOffer`. Devices assigned to the deployment will be offered the update according to the specified rate until all devices have been offered the update.

In this example, a new deployment is configured so that a new set of devices is offered the update every week (`durationBetweenOffers` set to seven days), starting on July 1, 2021. 100 devices will be offered the update at a time until all devices have been offered the update.
