# Create identityProvider

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Create a new [socialIdentityProvider](../resources/socialidentityprovider.md) object in Azure AD.

In Azure AD B2C create a new [socialIdentityProviders](../resources/socialidentityprovider.md), [openIdConnectIdentityProvider](../resources/openidconnectidentityprovider.md) or an [appleIdentityProvider](../resources/appleidentityprovider.md) object.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account)|IdentityProvider.ReadWrite.All|
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account)| Not supported.|
|Application|IdentityProvider.ReadWrite.All|

The work or school account needs to belong to one of the following roles:

* Global Administrator
* External Identity Provider Administrator

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
POST /identityProviders
```

## Request headers

|Name|Description|
|:---------------|:----------|
|Authorization|Bearer {token}. Required.|
|Content-Type|application/json. Required.|

## Request body

In the request body, provide a JSON representation of [socialIdentityProvider](../resources/socialidentityprovider.md) object in Azure AD.

In Azure AD B2C provide a JSON representation of [socialIdentityProviders](../resources/socialidentityprovider.md), [openIdConnectIdentityProvider](../resources/openidconnectidentityprovider.md) or an [appleIdentityProvider](../resources/appleidentityprovider.md) object.

All the properties listed in the following table are required.

### socialIdentityProvider object

|Property|Type|Description|
|:---------------|:--------|:----------|
|clientId|String|The client identifier for the application obtained when registering the application with the identity provider. Required.|
|clientSecret|String|The client secret for the application that is obtained when the application is registered with the identity provider. This is write-only. A read operation returns "\*\*\*\*". Required.|
|displayName|String|The display name of the identity provider.|
|identityProviderType|String|Required. For a B2B scenario, possible values: `Google`, `Facebook`. For a B2C scenario, possible values: `Microsoft`, `Google`, `Amazon`, `LinkedIn`, `Facebook`, `GitHub`, `Twitter`, `Weibo`, `QQ`, `WeChat`.|

### openIdConnectIdentityProvider object

|Property|Type|Description|
|:---------------|:--------|:----------|
|clientId|String|The client ID for the application obtained when registering the application with the identity provider. Required.|
|clientSecret|String|The client secret for the application obtained when registering the application with the identity provider. The clientSecret has a dependency on **responseType**. <ul><li>When **responseType** is `code`, a secret is required for the auth code exchange.</li><li>When **responseType** is `id_token` the secret is not required because there is no code exchangeâ€”the id_token is returned directly from the authorization response.</li></ul>|
|displayName|String|The display name of the identity provider. Required.|
|identityProviderType|String|The identity provider type. It must be `OpenIDConnect`. Required.|
|claimsMapping|[claimsMapping](claimsmapping.md)|After the OIDC provider sends an ID token back to Azure AD, Azure AD needs to be able to map the claims from the received token to the claims that Azure AD recognizes and uses. This complex type captures that mapping. Required.|
|domainHint|String|The domain hint can be used to skip directly to the sign in page of the specified identity provider, instead of having the user make a selection among the list of available identity providers.|
|metadataUrl|String|The URL for the metadata document of the OpenID Connect identity provider. Every OpenID Connect identity provider describes a metadata document that contains most of the information required to perform sign-in. This includes information such as the URLs to use and the location of the service's public signing keys. The OpenID Connect metadata document is always located at an endpoint that ends in `.well-known/openid-configuration`. Provide the metadata URL for the OpenID Connect identity provider you add. Read-only. Required.|
|responseMode|String|The response mode defines the method used to send data back from the custom identity provider to Azure AD B2C. The following response modes can be used: <ul><li>`form_post` : This response mode is recommended for best security. The response is transmitted via the HTTP POST method, with the code or token being encoded in the body using the application/x-www-form-urlencoded format.</li><li>`query` : The code or token is returned as a query parameter.</li></ul>|
|responseType|String|The response type describes the type of information sent back in the initial call to the authorization_endpoint of the custom identity provider. The following response types can be used:<ul><li> `code` : As per the authorization code flow, a code will be returned back to Azure AD B2C. Azure AD B2C proceeds to call the token_endpoint to exchange the code for the token.</li><li> `id_token` : An ID token is returned back to Azure AD B2C from the custom identity provider. </li><li>`token` : An access token is returned back to Azure AD B2C from the custom identity provider. (This value is not supported by Azure AD B2C at the moment)</li></ul>|
|scope|String|Scope defines the information and permissions you are looking to gather from your custom identity provider.|

### openIdConnectProvider object

|Property|Type|Description|
|:---------------|:--------|:----------|
|clientId|String|The client ID for the application. This is the client ID obtained when registering the application with the identity provider.|
|clientSecret|String|The client secret for the application. This is the client secret obtained when registering the application with the identity provider.|
|name|String|The display name of the identity provider.|
|type|String|The identity provider type. The value must be `OpenIdConnect`.|
|claimsMapping|[claimsMapping](../resources/claimsmapping.md)|The `userId` and `displayname` properties are required in the claimsMapping object.|
|metadataUrl|String|The URL for the metadata document of the Open Id Connect identity provider.|
|responseMode|String|Defines the method that should be used to send the data back from the custom identity provider to Azure AD B2C. The following response modes can be used: <ul><li/>`form_post` : This response mode is recommended for best security. The response is transmitted via the HTTP POST method, with the code or token being encoded in the body using the application/x-www-form-urlencoded format.<li/>`query` : The code or token is returned as a query parameter.</ul>|
|responseType|String|Describes what kind of information is sent back in the initial call to the authorization_endpoint of the custom identity provider. The following response types can be used:<ul><li/> `code` : As per the authorization code flow, a code will be returned back to Azure AD B2C. Azure AD B2C proceeds to call the token_endpoint to exchange the code for the token.<li/> `id_token` : An ID token is returned back to Azure AD B2C from the custom identity provider. <li/>`token` : An access token is returned back to Azure AD B2C from the custom identity provider. (This value is not supported by Azure AD B2C at the moment)</ul>|
|scope|String|Scope defines the information and permissions you are looking to gather from your custom identity provider.|

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `201 Created` response code and [identityProvider](../resources/identityprovider.md) or [openIdConnectProvider](../resources/openidconnectprovider.md) (only for Azure AD B2C) object in the response body. If unsuccessful, a `4xx` error will be returned with specific details.
